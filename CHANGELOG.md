# Changelog

## 1.0.2

* Temporarily adds the `experimental_volregion` feature, allowing a person to
  *experimentally* opt-in to the `VolRegion` type. This type will be part of a
  1.1 release of the crate at some point. This feature is **not** part of the
  crate's SemVer, and it will go away entirely once `VolRegion` becomes a stable
  part of the crate.

## 1.0.0

* Initial stable release.
